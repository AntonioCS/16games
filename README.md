This is the 16 games from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_omFPqMO4&list=PLB_ibvUSN7mzUffhiay5g5GUHyJRO4DYr

You can download the original code from: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1X24AF6OYBp0dFDdjtTx0nlTrGOHb4uRr 

## Plan

1 - Ensure that all games are compiled and run as shown on the videos using CMake and vcpkg (with minor source clean up)
2 - Reimplement them in SDL2
3 - Try reimplementation again but in OpenGL
